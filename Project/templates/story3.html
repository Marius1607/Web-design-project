	<blockquote style = "color:white; font-size:30px;">"Only in truth the lords will abandon their thrones and the unkindled will rise. Nameless accursed undead, unfit even to be cinder. And so it is, that ash seeketh embers." </blockquote>

<blockquote style = "color:white; font-size:30px;">"They say these are the remains of a saint who cast himself into the bonfire. But we will never know for sure, for soot and ashes tell no story." </blockquote>
		
<p id = "firstPart"> As the intro says, the Unkindled are beings of ash, unworthy to ascend to become Lords of Cinder. They are awakened by the tolling of a bell that rings when the First Flame is in danger of fading. They awaken in the Cemetery of Ash and seek the embers of the First Flame. During the whole game the protagonist is called Unkindled, Champion of Ash or Ashen One all of which harken back to the origins of the unkindled.

There are some speculations about what it means to be Unkindled. First of all, upon killing certain unkindled NPCs they drop ashes, meaning they were burned at some point before reviving.  Thus Unkindled are  perhaps either related to the bornfire creation process, or they are nameless Accursed undead who linked the First Flame but died in the process. The Lords of Cinder, on the other hand, were beings so powerful they did survive the linking and turned into Cinder instead of mere Ash.
		</p>
		
		<p id = "secondPart"> The first hint supporting this theory is a play between the words Cinder and Ash. The latter  refers to what remains after a material has been burnt completely while Cinder means that it has not been consumed completely. The Undead throw themselves in the bonfire and fuel the Flame but they are entirely consumed in the process, leaving only ashes that need embers to ignite. These ashes are found numerous times throughout the journey of the game, implying the cyclical nature of Dark and Flame. The intro sentence "Ash seeketh embers" takes shape now. Embers in the game are defined as:

"No Unkindled can ever truly claim the embers that burn within a championâ€™s bosom, which is precisely what makes their yearning for warmth so keen. Gain the strength of flame and increase max HP until death. With the strength of fire, the summoning signs of Unkindled become visible, and seekers of embers can be summoned to join in co-operation. But beware the embers may also attract invaders."

From DSII we know that many generations passed and many indivuals sacrified themselves to link the Flame and rekindle the fire. Lords of Cinder, came many generations after, and it is rare for someone to survive the fire. It seems one must be powerful in a unique way to survive and even then their form changes. Gwyn was a Lord of Cinder, but it is clear that his form was changed by the linking and it was a great sacrifice even for one as great as him.  A vast amount of generations passed, we would obviously have many of unkindled and, of course, many amount of tombs in the Cemetery of Ash. We also fight against a manifestation of all Undead who linked the fire, that is, the Soul of Cinder, who seems to be good at all fighting styles. 

Another hint supporting that Lords of Cinder did not burn completely and stayed alive after linking the fire is the fact that all unkindled resurrect with their human forms. All Lords of Cinder wake up with their charred corpses, like Ludleth, and they all seem to have gained certain amount of fire power, juding by their boss fights.  Aldrich did not die either, he had a vision of an upcoming Age of the Deep Sea, so he started devouring Gods. 

The last detail relating the Unkindled to all of the previous Undead who sacrified themselves for the Flame is found in a song.  The name of this song is mentioned  in the intro of DSIII. when you beat DSI you see your character burning in the kiln and then The Nameless Song starts to play.  This sad tone is played at the end of your quest and it is what defines your character.  Our characters did everything and died a thousand of times just to be a sacrifice to extend the age of the gods. It happened many times, and they are nameless, no one is going to remember their names or write poems about them.  

Whatever unkindled are, their task is clear. They have  to seek out the Lords Of Cinder in order to reenact relinking the First Flame and preserve the age of fire. They are also undead who are not fully bound by the hollowing process we saw in past games, needing to acquire Dark Sigils in order to go Hollow. 	</p>
